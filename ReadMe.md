# Pixel Art Maker Project

#This project draws table with many cells and adds color to the cells.
#The number of cells in the grid is entered into the Grid Height and 
#Grid Width and clicking on the submit button produces the table.
#Choose a color from the 'Pick A Color' and click in each cell to produce
#the pattern of your choice.
